Final Project README

My idea for a report on Senate finance disclosures is to look at how many Senators have made amendments to their disclosures. A visualization idea is to show a graph of number of amendments by year. And also to break it down by party (i.e. Republican vs Democratic).

Sen. Bob Corker Failed to Properly Disclose Millions of Dollars in Income: https://www.wsj.com/articles/sen-bob-corker-failed-to-properly-disclose-millions-of-dollars-in-income-1450051046
Senators often file amendments to correct small mistakes and oversights in their financial-disclosure forms, but it is unusual for a member of Congress to amend all of their financial reports in one sweep; Mr. Corker had failed to properly disclose at least $2 million in income from investments in three small hedge funds based in his home state. The question now is whether senators should be punished. “You can’t just disclose once you get caught,” said Anne Weismann, president of the Campaign for Accountability. Filing new financial reports “doesn’t change the fact that he failed to disclose properly the first time.”

Cruz says he may amend U.S. financial disclosures to show loans to 2012 Senate campaign: http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/cruz-says-he-may-amend-us-financial-disclosures-to-show-loans-to-2012/2261423
Making amendments to disclosures allows the public to evaluate senators' choices. Cruz and his wife obtained low-interest loans from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. in the first half of 2012; the funds totaled as much as $750,000 and increased to a maximum of $1 million, which cited personal financial disclosures that didn't cite an explanation for their purpose. Cruz said he'll amend finance reports from his 2012 Texas Senate bid, if necessary, to show he received loans to cover campaign costs. He blames Goldman Sachs for being a beneficiary of "crony capitalism."

Kushner updates financial disclosure after omitting dozens of assets: report- http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/343250-kushner-updates-financial-disclosure-after-omitting-dozens-of-assets
It's not unusual for a financial disclosure form to be revised, and that Mr. Kushner’s lawyers had prepared the form on his behalf. But, the Office of Government Ethics, which is charged with reviewing and certifying administration officials’ financial disclosure forms, didn’t respond to a question about whether it was customary to revise the form to the extent Mr. Kushner did. Kushner's initial filing omitted dozens of assets, including commercial real estate, bonds issued by the New York water and sewer authority, a personal art collection and a New Jersey liquor license.

McCaskill amends past personal financial reports, including reports on stock of opioid manufacturer: http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/mccaskill-amends-past-personal-financial-reports-including-reports-on-stock/article_bccb4371-c194-5c72-a293-e6a3bdeddc6e.html
McCaskill has removed eight investment transactions that collectively added up to between $400,008 and $1.05 million from two years of her annual personal financial disclosure reports, saying they should have instead been listed as transactions of a family foundation she formed with her husband, Joseph Shepard. One series of transactions removed was the purchase in stock of Allergan, an opioid manufacturer sued by the state of Ohio for contributing to an opioid crisis.

Ahlquist to amend financial disclosure report after paying family member: https://www.kivitv.com/news/ahlquist-to-amend-financial-disclosure-report-after-paying-family-member
A prominent Idaho Republican gubernatorial candidate says he will submit an amended campaign financial disclosure report after it showed he paid a family member with campaign funds. Ahlquist reported paying his son-in-law $20,000 for wages in his latest campaign disclosure funds; Campaign manager David Johnston says the payment should have been reported as an in-kind contribution and not as a campaign expenditure because it came from his personal account.
